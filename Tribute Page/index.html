            <p>
              Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an
              Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who
              headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the
              Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister
              in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit
              Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.
              <br /><br />
              After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay,
              Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London
              School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923,
              respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have
              done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the
              law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an
              economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his
              political activities; he became involved in campaigning and
              negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating
              political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing
              to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted
              to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

              In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was
              posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit.
              "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to
              by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected
              Father".

            <h3>Post Secondary Education</h3>
            <p>
              In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became
              the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906,
              when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl,
              Ramabai. The match was arranged by the couple's parents, in
              accordance with prevailing custom at that time.

            <h3>Studies at the University of Bombay</h3>
            <p>
              In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the
              following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was
              affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to
              him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his
              English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community
              wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached
              "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to
              the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony
              was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was
              at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the
              Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend. By 1912,
              he obtained his degree in economics and political science from
              Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the
              Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family
              and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see
              his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.

            <h3>Studies at Columbia University</h3>
            <p>
              In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State
              Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a
              scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda)
              that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate
              education at Columbia University in New York City. Soon after
              arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval
              Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his
              M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects
              of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a
              thesis, Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John
              Dewey and his work on democracy. In 1916, he completed his second
              master's thesis, National Dividend of India – A Historic and
              Analytical Study, for a second M.A. On 9 May, he presented the
              paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development
              before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist Alexander
              Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at
              Columbia in 1927.

            <h1 id="title-a">Opposition to untouchability</h1>

            <p>
              While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote
              education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised
              attempt was his establishment of the central institution
              Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha, intended to promote education and
              socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "outcastes",
              at the time referred to as depressed classes. For the defence of
              Dalit rights, he started many periodicals like Mook Nayak,
              Bahishkrit Bharat, and Equality Janta. He was appointed to the
              Bombay Presidency Committee to work with the all-European Simon
              Commission in 1925. This commission had sparked great protests
              across India, and while its report was ignored by most Indians,
              Ambedkar himself wrote a separate set of recommendations for the
              future Constitution of India. By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to
              launch active movements against untouchability. He began with
              public movements and marches to open up public drinking water
              resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu
              temples. He led a satyagraha in Mahad to fight for the right of
              the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank
              of the town. In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly
              condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu),
              for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and
              "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient
              text. On 25 December 1927, he led thousands of followers to burn
              copies of Manusmriti. Thus annually 25 December is celebrated as
              Manusmriti Dahan Din (Manusmriti Burning Day) by Ambedkarites and
              Dalits. In 1930, Ambedkar launched the Kalaram Temple movement
              after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers
              assembled at Kalaram Temple satygraha making one of the greatest
              processions of Nashik. The procession was headed by a military
              band and a batch of scouts; women and men walked with discipline,
              order and determination to see the god for the first time. When
              they reached the gates, the gates were closed by Brahmin
              authorities.
